## Files explanation

1. Data scraping code: "indeed scraper.py"  

2. Datafile: "24-05jobsInfo.csv"  

3. Data preparation and analysis: "Job Market Analysis.ipynb"  


## Future of the project

If the project were to continue, we would proceed to productionising the code, in order to provide live daily updates. To gather more insights (for ex. number of jobs for each position type, information about all cities in Germany and eventually beyond, time when most jobs are posted etc), we could connect to API of portals like Indeed or LinkedIn. The data would be loaded into a database that we would set up, and then website would use the data stored there to produce the graphs. Of course, the website would need to be adjusted to display additional elements. Daily data collection would also allow for more precise figures, historical overview of job market trends, and impact of other events (apart from COVID-19) as they happen over time. It could be a go to tool for anyone trying to understand the employment situation in their country - job searchers, companies, economists, etc.
